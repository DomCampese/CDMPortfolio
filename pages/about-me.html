                Hi there! I'm Dom Campese, a junior studying at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in 
                Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. I really enjoy projects like this where my interest in technology
                intersects with my other interestsâ€”in this case Psychology. Once I finish school, I plan
                on working as a Software Engineer, most likely working on both the front end (what you see)
                and the back end (what the server sees). I am passionate about digital creation, but previously
                lacked experience with a lot of powerful software like Photoshop and Premiere Pro which is what
                drove me to take a digital media course in the first place. Through my course work in Composing 
                Digital Media, I have learned multiple such technologies and I plan to keep learning and making 
                from here on out.
