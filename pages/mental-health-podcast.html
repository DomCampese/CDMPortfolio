            <h1>Talk It Out - Mental Health Podcast</h1>

            <p>
                Talk it out is my project for the audio medium where I envisioned a 
                fictional podcast where I talk to college students of varied backgrounds
                and career paths to give them a chance to express themselves and to listen to and understand 
                their experiences and opinions. For the episode I created about work-life balance in school, 
                I interviewed three of my roomates; Joey, Andrew, and Jack to get an idea of how each of us view our workloads
                and mental state during the semester. Going in to the podcast, I expected my roomates to mirror
                my sentiments regarding work life balance; that there is essentially too much work and too little 
                free time. Interestingly, I found that two of my roomates have found ways to maximize thier free time
                and in turn, quality of life during the semester. I found the podcast to be an opportunity for 
                listening, learning, and self-reflection.
