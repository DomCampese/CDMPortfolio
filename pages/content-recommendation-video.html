            <h1>Content Recommendation Video</h1>
            <p>
                For the video project, we were to choose a topic relating to a social issue, 
                so I decided to research and discuss the idea of content recommendation and the negative effects
                it might have on the users of the many applications that use the technology. This issue aligns well with my interests and is a
                modern and underresearched problem that I figured would be a good topic to spread awareness of.
                After stumbling upon the work of Eli Parsier, an author, activist, and Ted Talk speaker, I learned that the negatives 
                associated with content recommendation are caused by a phenomenon called a "Filter bubble" or 
                "Echo chamber" that can potentially alter a person's political beliefs and leads to the use 
                of their data without consent. This technology might affect not only the content that we take 
                in and experience, but also the beliefs that make us who we are.
